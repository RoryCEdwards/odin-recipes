            <li>About 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>5 ounces (150 g) dried narrow flat rice noodles</li>
            <li>2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>About 1/2 teaspoon organic sugar, or 1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)</li>
            <li>Pepper (optional)</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the broth ingredients:</h3>
            <p> Peel then slice the ginger into 4 or 5 coins. Smack with the flat side of a knife or meat mallet; set aside. Thinly slice the green parts of the green onion to yield 2 to 3 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Cut the leftover sections into pinkie-finger lengths, bruise, then add to the ginger.</p>

            <p>Coarsely chop the leafy tops of the cilantro to yield 2 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Set the remaining cilantro sprigs aside.</p></li>

            <li><h3>Toast the broth ingredients:</h3>
            <p>In a 3- to 4-quart (3 to 4 l) pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger and green onion sections. Stir for about 30 seconds, until aromatic. </p></li>

            <li><h3>Add the broth and bring to a simmer:</h3>
            <p> Slide the pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then pour in the broth.</p>

            <p>Return the pot to the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs, chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to gently simmer. </p></li>

            <li><h3>Remove the chicken from the broth once cooked:</h3>
            <p>After 5 to 10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and cooked through (press on it and it should slightly yield). </p></li>

            <li><h3>Simmer the broth:</h3>
            <p>Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 30 minutes simmering time). </p></li>

            <li><h3>Shred the chicken:</h3>
            <p>Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size pieces. Cover loosely to prevent drying.</p></li>

            <li><h3>Soak the rice noodles:</h3>
            <p>Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside. </p></li>

            <li><h3>Strain the broth:</h3>
            <p> When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer positioned over a 2-quart (2-liter) pot; line the strainer with muslin for superclear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4 cups. </p>
            <p>Season with fish sauce and sugar (or maple syrup), if needed, to create a strong savory-sweet note. </p></li>

            <li><h3>Finish the pho:</h3>
            <p>Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in a noodle strainer or mesh sieve and dunk in the hot broth to heat and soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide between the 2 bowls. [Emma's note: I didn't find it necessary to soften my noodles any further. I just added them to the bowls and poured the hot broth over top. However, dunking them in the broth would make them more flavorful!]</p>
            <p>Lower the heat to keep the broth hot while you arrange the chicken on top of the noodles and garnish with the chopped green onion, cilantro, and a sprinkling of pepper. Taste and adjust the brothâ€™s saltiness one last time. Return the broth to a boil and ladle into the bowls. Enjoy with any extras, if you like. </p></li>
